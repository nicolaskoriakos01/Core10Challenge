# Core 10 QA Engineer Challenge - Nicolas Koriakos

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Core 10 QA Engineer Challenge repository. This space showcases my skills and approach to quality assurance as part of the assessment provided by Core 10.

## About Me:

I am Nicolas Koriakos, a passionate Quality Assurance Engineer excited about ensuring the highest standards of software quality. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work on the challenges presented by Core 10.


## Set up

Before we begin, there are a couple of steps we should take to ensure everything is ready for action:

1 - You should have docker installed (this is to run the API provided by Core 10).

2 - Now that we have docker we should get the repo from the API we are testing.<br><br>
here you go: https://github.com/alexmgriffiths/compose-weather  now that you have it you just need to do a git clone on it :D

3 - For our final step the only thing you need to do is go to the folder (using your CMD) where you have the compose-weather repo and there run this command: <b> docker-compose up -d <b>

4 - if everything went right we should be able to start testing. <br><br>
a safe bet in order to check if everything is okay is trying to access the following link: http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html you should be able to access it. <br><br>
if you aren't you can contact me and I'll be happy to help :)

# TEST PLAN

This is a one endpoint test plan so I decided to keep it short and to the point, based on the fact that we only need to execute a GET API most of the test cases are going to be positive because we donâ€™t really have to do any data input besides the url itself.

# Background before test: 
It is expected to get a 200 response everytime we run the WeatherForecast endpoint.

<br>
On the fisr tab you have the test cases and on the second one the bugs.

 1 - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NO5AxRx33iBmbPRH-ndFqp2hico77aRNwyJrw28p6tU/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">Positive Test cases and bugs.</a> <br>
 2 - For the negative test cases I decided to try only one, this would be running an invalid endpoint: <br>

Endpoint -> http://localhost:8080/InvalidEndpoint <br>
Expected result -> Error 404 not found <br>
Actual result -> Error 404 not found <br>
Test result -> Pass <br>

# Test Automation

PRE-REQUISITES: JAVA INSTALLED(With JAVA_HOME Set Up), MAVEN INSTALLED

For this part I decided to use Java + RestAssured with cucumber and TestNG.
I decided to automate a single testcase where it validates the data. in this test case the data validated is the date and the temperature conversion.<br><br>
The validation on date is to check if any of the dates showed are from before the current date.<br><br>
The validation for temperature is to check if the conversion from Farenheit to celcius work correctly.<br><br>
The main goal of the automation is to show how I set up a rest assured endpoint using different tools and different utils classes to make it as scalable as posible, I also added comments to explain what I did in my code.<br>
If you have any question please let me know!

# HOW TO RUN IT

1 - you should clone this repo to your local machine. <br>
2 - Open the project on the IDE of your choice. <br>
3 - Navigate to the GET_WeatherForecast.feature file. <br>
4 - hit the run button. <br>

If this does not work please contact me and I will help you in any way possible.
